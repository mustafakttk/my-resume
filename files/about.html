    <p>Hi, I’m <b>Mustafa Khattak</b>  <br />
I’m a <b>17-year-old Pre-Medical student</b> who also has a strong passion for coding and technology. <br />

My programming journey began back in 7th grade, when I first explored <b>HTML & CSS</b> and then in 8th grade, I got introduced to basic <b>Python (Turtle)</b>. For a while, I stepped away from coding to focus on my medical studies, but my curiosity for tech never left. <br />

Now, after <b>two years</b>, I’ve decided to return to programming—this time with a focus on <b>Web Development</b>. I’m learning every day, building projects, and working toward becoming a professional Full-Stack Web Developer. <br />

Outside of coding, I enjoy writing, creating content, and continuously exploring new skills in this digital age.</p>
